Just playing around with RestEasy [Will continue move onto spring or quarkus]

- Area that are covered
-- Manual dependency injection
-- Just normal crud route
 
- Area that can be added
-- How enviroment variables are properly handled
-- Connection to Database considering using hibernate just for quick implementation
-- Proper Validation exception handling for other than base exception such as 300/400/500
